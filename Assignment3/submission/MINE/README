This is a small simulation based on HEARTBLEED bug used to exploit the OpenSSL v1.01
This is based on client-sever model where OpenSSL provides security over https webpages.

HOW TO RUN:

    RUN SERVER:
        ***python server.py***

    RUN CLIENT:        this is executed on differnt terminal. (Server must be running)
        ***python client.py***

        Now you can use terminal running client to communicate to server which is considered safe due to OpenSSL secure SSL/TSL.

        ~Write your message in CLIENT terminal to communicate to SERVER
        ~Wrtie *ATTACK* to switch to HEARTBLEED mode of attack.
                ^ Enter message
                ^ Enter Lager size to exploit the vulnerability
        ~Write *BYE* to close the connection betweeen client and server.
