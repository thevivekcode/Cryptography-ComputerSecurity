speaking of dreams in a figurative sense then slowly talking about its impact in the literal sense the
writer keeps stressing on one very important point that dreams have an important role to play in
american politics after all a liberal society is formed on the basis of ones imagination these imaginations
are a result of ones free thoughts which can be related to dreams as dreaming provides a picture of the
real world uncovering things which otherwise might not have been pondered upon due to narrowed and
limited freedom of imagining it may seem reckless to consider the possibility of turning to dreams to
work through the political conditions today but ignoring them altogether might even be more reckless
