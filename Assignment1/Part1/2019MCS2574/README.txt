Follow README instructions to run the encryption and decryption script:

1. ENCRYPTION
    run the following command:

    python HillCipherEncryption.py ["key file location"] ["plainText file location"]

    ouput: EncryptionOutput.txt


2. DECRYPTION
    run the following command:

    python HillCipherDecryption.py ["key file location"] ["cipherText file location"]

    ouput: DecryptionOutput.txt


*ERROR in input*

if GCD(det(KEY),26) !=1
    script ends with error message

*input assumption*

"key will be in integer values sepeated by whitespaces"
key will automatically be generated choosing closest square value
eg1. if key size is 10 : key will be generated by first 9 digits
eg2. if key size is 15 : key will be generated by first 9 digits

plainText and cipherText will be english letter a-z
